  <h2>Ryan Skinner</h2>
  <div class="inset-right"> <img alt="Ryan and Dov" src="img/rydov_small.jpg" /> </div>
  <p>Ryan's passion for music began in the theater. Growing up in Minneapolis,
    Ryan performed with a number of the city's theatrical companies where he
    cultivated his voice for the stage. At the age of fourteen, Ryan received
    his first guitar, and, gradually, he left the theater to develop other interests
    &ndash; prominent among them, music. </p>
  <p>In college, Ryan sought to formalize his amateur knowledge of the guitar
    by studying classical, folk, and blues styles. At the same time, strong friendships
    were forming around musical collaborations. Dov and Ryan found each other,
    playing percussion and guitar respectively &ndash; music was their first
    common language. </p>
  <p>In 1997, Dov asked Ryan to listen to a recording; it was an album featuring
    kora virtuoso Toumani Diabat&eacute;. The music of the twenty-one stringed
    harp captivated him. The following year, Ryan was in Bamako, Mali's capital
    city, where he was invited to live with Toumani's family, a clan of griots
    (West African bards) who practice a centuries-old musical art. Toumani initiated
    Ryan as a kora student. </p>
  <p>Ten years later, Ryan's apprenticeship continues, though now he teaches
    and performs kora music, in and out of Africa. Through his work with Dov,
    Ryan has developed a unique voice on the instrument, putting his American
    roots in dialogue with his African routes. Bafilab&egrave;n is the result
    of this polyvocal experiment. </p>
  <h2>Dov Stucker</h2>
  <p>Dov began playing guitar at age eight, writing his first song soon after.
    Since then, despite cycles of regular practice alternating with longer periods
    of quiescence, the melodies have always been there, in his head.</p>
  <div class="inset-left"> <img alt="Ryan and Dov in black and white" src="img/rydov_bw_small.jpg" /> </div>
  <p>The period between 1995 and 2000 was a renaissance, of sorts, a time held
    together by the thread of musical friendship, and improvisation, late into
    the night. Ryan&rsquo;s strings were part of that collaboration&mdash;although
    at that point, there were only six of them.</p>
  <p>A second wave of creativity culminated in 2001 with the release of Last
    Day of January, an album Dov produced with his partner, Sara Mason. Through
    this project, his musical identity matured and his connection to American
    acoustic traditions deepened. </p>
  <p>But just as his roots were strengthening, his branches were reaching out.
    From 1996 to the present, Dov&rsquo;s musical influences expanded, and have
    been fed by many of the cultural landscapes in which he has lived and traveled&mdash;especially
    those of Africa and the Caribbean. </p>
  <p>Reconnecting with Ryan, and bringing together the two rivers of their instruments,
    melodies, and experiences, has been a natural development in this musical
    journey. The result, despite the distance from New England to Mali, feels
    like coming home.</p>
  <h2>Sara Mason</h2>
  <div class="inset-right"> <img alt="Kaye's Train" src="img/kayestrain_small.jpg" /> </div>
  <p>Sara has been playing and writing music for years. Her music remains a part
    of a constellation of creative pursuits, including pottery, painting, and
    mixed media work.</p>
